* Ideas
- To use any kind of wavelet transformation is very reasonable, butterworth filter was helpful for me to suppress the sine shape, DWT to obtain its close approximation - sometimes it is disrupted, and denoising with feature extractions are the alchemy of this competition. - from "Competition Kickoff"

* Task List
** TODO Try Something [0/3]
- [ ] [Re-]Read "Complex Classifiation of PD" pdf
- [ ] Poke around with PyWavelets
- [ ] Implemente high pass filter to remove 50 Hz signal
- [ ] What is boosting?
** TODO Check performance metrics
- [ ] ROC score
- [ ] Precision and Recall 
- [ ] F-score
